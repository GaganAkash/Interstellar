# Project Conclusion

This project successfully implements a secure, user-friendly web application for file storage and sharing using decentralized IPFS technology. The system integrates a Flask backend API with a React frontend, providing seamless user authentication, encrypted file upload and download, and real-time visualizations of IPFS data flow.

Key achievements include:

- Robust user authentication with password hashing, account lockout, and session management.
- Secure file handling with AES-256 encryption, chunking, and Merkle root hash generation for IPFS storage.
- QR code generation for easy sharing of IPFS content identifiers.
- A responsive and intuitive React frontend with protected routes and dynamic UI components.
- Comprehensive system design ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.

Future enhancements can further improve security, usability, and functionality, such as implementing two-factor authentication, file versioning, and advanced access controls.

Overall, the project demonstrates effective integration of modern web technologies and decentralized storage solutions to meet contemporary data management needs.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.
